# A Classification Model for the Second Extracellular Loop of Class A GPCRs 

This repository contains code for the web app providing interactive 
supplemental information about the classification model
for the Second Extracellular Loop (ECL2) of Class A GPCR receptors. The web
app is currently hosted at [ecl2.giorginolab.it](http://ecl2.giorginolab.it).
